List of 100 Node.js interview questions:

1. What is Node.js and why is it used?
Answer: Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It enables developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, which traditionally was handled by other languages like PHP, Python, or Java. This allows for JavaScript to be used across the entire stack(i.e, frontend and backend), promoting a unified development experience.

Node.js is particularly known for its non-blocking, event-driven(means that the system responds to events (like user actions or network requests) and processes them asynchronously, allowing the application to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking other operations) architecture. This means it can handle multiple requests concurrently without waiting for each one to complete before starting the next. This makes Node.js highly efficient and suitable for building scalable network applications, such as real-time chat applications, online gaming, and APIs that need to handle many connections simultaneously.

One of the standout features of Node.js is its package manager, npm, which provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and packages that can significantly accelerate development. Its asynchronous nature and event loop model make it ideal for I/O-heavy tasks, such as reading files, querying databases, or making network requests, as it can handle these operations without blocking other tasks.

Analogy:
Think of Node.js as a highly efficient restaurant kitchen. Imagine a kitchen where the chef (Node.js) can start preparing a dish, then immediately move on to the next order without waiting for the first dish to be fully cooked before starting the next. This way, the kitchen can handle many orders simultaneously, ensuring that all dishes are served quickly and efficiently. Similarly, Node.js handles multiple client requests simultaneously, ensuring that your server remains responsive and capable of managing a high volume of interactions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Explain the event-driven architecture of Node.js.
Answer: The event-driven architecture of Node.js is one of its most powerful features. At its core, Node.js uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations, which is key for scalability. When a request comes in, instead of blocking the entire process to wait for a response, Node.js registers the event (like reading from a file or querying a database) and moves on to handle other requests. Once the operation is complete, the registered callback function is executed. This is what makes Node.js non-blocking, allowing it to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

The core idea is that Node.js doesn’t wait for any I/O operations to complete. Instead, it assigns tasks, listens for events, and responds when they’re ready, making it highly suitable for building fast, scalable applications.

Analogy: 
Think of Node.js as a restaurant with one chef who’s really good at multitasking. Instead of waiting around for the oven to finish cooking or the water to boil, the chef starts preparing other orders. When something is done (like the oven timer going off), the chef quickly attends to it without pausing all the other work. This way, the kitchen runs smoothly, and multiple meals can be prepared at the same time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What are the main features of Node.js?

Answer: 1. Non-blocking, Asynchronous I/O: One of the core strengths of Node.js is its non-blocking, asynchronous nature. This means it can handle multiple tasks at once without waiting for one to complete before moving on to the next. For instance, if it makes a database request, it won’t just sit idle until the response comes back. Instead, it'll keep working on other tasks, and once the data is ready, it'll come back to process it.
Example: Imagine you’re hosting a dinner party and waiting for food to be delivered. Instead of standing by the door waiting, you continue chatting with guests or setting the table. When the food arrives, you pause, get it, and then continue with your tasks.

2. Single-threaded Event Loop: Node.js runs on a single thread, unlike many other platforms that use multiple threads to handle tasks. It achieves high performance by using an event loop. The event loop constantly checks for tasks in the queue and processes them efficiently, making it highly scalable for I/O-heavy applications.
Example: It's like having one cashier in a store, but instead of waiting to process every customer one-by-one, the cashier quickly deals with customers who are ready and then goes back to help others once they're ready (like if someone’s waiting for a price check).

3. V8 Engine: Node.js runs on Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used in Chrome. V8 is known for its speed and efficiency in executing JavaScript. It takes JavaScript code and compiles it into machine code that your computer understands, leading to fast performance.
Example: It’s like having a top-tier chef in your kitchen who can quickly take recipes (JavaScript code) and turn them into gourmet meals (machine code) in no time.

4. NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js comes with NPM, a huge library of packages and modules. These packages are reusable pieces of code that other developers have created. It saves you a lot of time by allowing you to quickly integrate pre-built functionalities into your project.
Example: It’s like having a fully stocked toolbox when working on a project. Instead of creating every tool from scratch, you can simply grab what you need and focus on the bigger task.

5. Cross-platform Compatibility: Node.js works on various platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing developers to build cross-platform applications without worrying about different operating systems. 
Example: It’s like writing a single recipe that works for cooking in both electric and gas stoves without any changes!

Real Time Usecase:
Think of Node.js like a food delivery app that handles thousands of orders simultaneously. Instead of having one person delivering food to one house at a time, it sends out multiple delivery drivers (tasks) while keeping track of every order (event loop). It never waits for one driver to return before sending out the next—it’s all about efficiency, speed, and handling many things at once!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?

Answer: Node.js uses something called non-blocking I/O with an event-driven architecture, meaning it can handle multiple operations at the same time without waiting for one to finish before starting another.
Let me explain that with an example. Say you are building a web server in Node.js, and you need to read some files from the disk. If Node.js handled things synchronously (like traditional programming languages), it would wait for the file reading operation to finish before moving on to the next task. This would make the server slow, especially if it had multiple tasks to perform.
But in Node.js, operations like reading files, making network requests, or querying databases are asynchronous. When you tell Node.js to read a file, it sends the request to the file system and immediately moves on to handle the next task, without waiting. Once the file is read, Node.js gets notified through a callback, promise, or async/await mechanism, and then it processes the result.
This is achieved using the event loop and callbacks. The event loop is like a queue where tasks are lined up and executed when their results are ready. Node.js doesn’t block or freeze waiting for things to finish; instead, it keeps working on other tasks.

For example, imagine you're a waiter at a restaurant. When you take an order from a customer, you don’t wait in the kitchen until the food is ready. Instead, you go to other tables and take more orders, bring drinks, etc. Once the kitchen tells you the food is ready, you go back to serve it. Node.js works similarly: it doesn’t wait around, it keeps doing other things and comes back when the result is ready.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.Interviewer: What is the role of the event loop in Node.js?

Answer: The event loop is a core part of Node.js's asynchronous architecture, responsible for handling non-blocking I/O operations. Node.js uses a single-threaded event-driven model, where the event loop allows it to manage multiple tasks concurrently without creating additional threads for each request. The event loop listens for incoming events (such as file reads, HTTP requests, or database queries) and delegates tasks to be executed by background workers or the operating system. Once these operations complete, the results are returned to the event loop, which then executes the appropriate callback functions in a sequential manner. This design ensures that Node.js can handle large numbers of I/O-bound operations efficiently, maintaining high performance even under heavy loads.

Real time example...
Think of the event loop as a restaurant manager. The manager (event loop) takes orders (tasks) from customers (incoming requests) and delegates them to chefs (background workers or OS processes). While the chefs are preparing meals (handling operations like reading from a file or querying a database), the manager continues taking orders from other customers without having to wait. When the meals are ready, the manager serves them to the appropriate customer (executes the callback), ensuring that every order is processed in the order it was received. This way, the manager keeps the restaurant running smoothly, attending to many customers simultaneously without being overwhelmed.
